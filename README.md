<h1>Binary Converter</h1>
Just a little play around with C++, my second day with the language and created a decimal and binary converter. Decimal numbers to binary and vice versa. Just wanted to practice some of the new datastructures and the libarries that I am getting used to for C++ as again this is my second day with the language. From here I am debating whether or not to add a GUI so that I can practice building user interfaces with C++. Anyway, I hope someone at least finds this code useful.

But look around, and I know that it isn't real binary it is just strings and integers but this was just a basic project so don't get mad at me I am still only a freshman in high school. Hope you like it.
